# Our Story

Welcome to our dog blog!

We are a couple living in Greater Los Angeles.  By the end of 2014, we had two Australian Cattle Dogs (ACDs), Kira and Dino. Over the course of 7 years, we lived in small apartments to big houses. From the suburbs to the city. What have we learned? No matter the living situation, an ACD will always need a job, designated play time, and plenty of rest. As the saying goes, a tired dog is a good dog.

We know from personal experience the emotional rollercoaster it can be to raise an ACD puppy. We want to share our experiences and what we have learned. We cannot begin to describe how much they have tested our patience, our personal relationship, and our overall mental health. We have by no means perfected our relationship with them, but we have reached a place of mutual understanding. Hopefully, what we have experienced and learned over the years can become a helpful tool to those who are venturing into this journey of raising a cattle dog.

# Our Mission

“Help humans bond and evolve with their furry companions in a compassionate and mutually beneficial manner towards an exciting future.” 

Have you ever watched Samurai Jack?  We foresee a future where, through evolution and technology, dogs are seen as equals to humans.  We want to help society make progress towards this exciting future.

We hope that through our shared experiences, everyone can gain a valuable insight into understanding their dogs and their needs. After we begin to understand how our dogs communicate with us, we can in turn learn a lot about ourselves. By observing our dogs, we can learn to be mindful of our emotions and body language as dogs will always reflect back to us how we come across to others.
